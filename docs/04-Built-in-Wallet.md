# Built-in Wallet

To enhance the user experience, a built-in wallet is integrated into the trading client. The trading UI manages user balances based on the latest DEPOSIT, SWAP, BUY, and SELL activities. This built-in wallet ensures a seamless experience by signing transactions in the background. To maintain a trustless process, each transaction presents a simple summary **integrated in the UI** to the user, who can then choose to confirm or discard it.
