# Know Your Asset (KYA) Protocol

All transactions are settled on L1 and incur a transaction fee. CrystalPool maintains a public set of unsubmitted transactions, with real-time balance calculations based on the latest known state. Security is ensured as CrystalPool cannot move user balances without the userPK. In case of service shutdown, users can withdraw their deposits/orders after the unlockHeight period.
